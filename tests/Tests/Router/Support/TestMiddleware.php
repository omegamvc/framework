 * Class TestMiddleware
 *
 * A simple middleware class used in BasicRouteTest to verify that route middleware
 * is executed correctly for both single routes and route groups.
 *
 * This middleware updates a global indicator in the $_SERVER superglobal and tracks
 * the number of times it has been invoked using the static property $last.
 *
 * It is intended only for testing purposes, to assert that middleware registration
 * and execution in the Omega Router system behave as expected.
